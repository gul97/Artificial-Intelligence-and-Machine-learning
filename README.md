# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-learning will The Future of Healthcare
 
Contributed: The power of AI in surgery As the healthcare sector continues to expand, the volume and complexity of the data used growÂ exponentially. To deliver rapid and efficient medical care, healthcare providers must collect and access data accurately and quickly.

Artificial intelligence (AI), defined as algorithms that allow machines to perform cognitive functions (such as difficulty-explaining and decision-making), has improved for some time now in the appearance of healthcare through machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP).

However, compared to other medical specializations, it took longer for technology to be used in surgical procedures. This was mostly because there was a lack of information about the potential for computational implementation in real-world surgery. AI is currently seen as an addition to human surgeons' competence rather than a substitute because of the rapid advancements that have been recorded.

Although the relationship between the surgeon, patient, and machine has a lot of promise, using AI in surgery is already bringing about big improvements for both patients and doctors.

For instance, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have consistently improved surgical planning and navigation, while minimally invasive surgery (MIS), when used in conjunction with robotic assistance, has reduced surgical trauma and enhanced patient recovery.

## How AI is shaping preoperative planning

Surgeons arrange the surgical procedure during the preoperative planning phase using the patient's medical history and imaging. Deep learning, which has been utilized for anatomical categorization, detection segmentation, and image registration, is boosting this step, which combines broad image-analysis approaches and traditional machine learning for classification.
Calvarial fracture, cerebral bleeding, and midline shift were among the anomalies in CT scan that deep learning algorithms were able to recognize. Emergency care is made possible for these abnormalities because of deep learning, which also holds promise for the automation of triage in the future.
Deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN), which have been used to forecast mortality and postoperative bleeding following cardiac surgery as well as renal failure in real-time, have shown better outcomes than conventional clinical reference methods.
